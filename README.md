# Golden Years Fitness ‚Äî Static site (pt-home-page)

This repository contains a small static website for "Golden Years Fitness". It's plain HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript and is intended to be served via GitHub Pages.

Live demo (GitHub Pages):

- https://massexile.github.io/pt-home-page/

## What is here

- `index.html` ‚Äî Home page
- `about.html` ‚Äî Team / About page
- `services.html` ‚Äî Services listing
- `resources.html` ‚Äî Resources page (sidebar with downloads)
- `contact.html` ‚Äî Contact form + map
- `styles.css` ‚Äî Site styles
- `images/` ‚Äî Images used across the site
- `downloads/` ‚Äî PDF resources (added for download links)
- `README.md` ‚Äî This file

## Quick notes for maintenance

- GitHub Pages is case-sensitive. Keep filenames and links lowercase and consistent (e.g. `resources.html`, `images/lisa.png`).
- To preview locally, open `index.html` in your browser. No build step is required.
- To add or replace downloadable PDFs, put them in the `downloads/` folder and commit. Use relative links in `resources.html` like:

  <a href="downloads/fitness-guide.pdf" download>Fitness Guide (PDF)</a>

## How deployment works

- The site is served from the `main` branch root via GitHub Pages. After pushing to `main` GitHub Pages deploys automatically (may take a minute to propagate).

## Security & accessibility reminders

- Keep any private data out of the repo. Do not store secrets in HTML/CSS.
- Add `aria-label` attributes and clear link text for screen-reader users (especially for downloads and navigation).

## Short changelog

- Fixed image paths to be relative instead of leading-slash absolute paths so assets load correctly on GitHub Pages.
- Renamed/created lowercase `resources.html` to avoid case-sensitive 404s on Pages.
- Added `downloads/` and uploaded three PDF resources with links in the resources sidebar.

## Troubleshooting

- If an asset 404s after a push, wait a minute and hard-refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5). If still failing, check the exact URL in DevTools (Network tab) and verify the file exists in the repo.
- Avoid nested Git repositories inside this repo ‚Äî they can block commits and push operations.

---

If you'd like, I can:

- Convert the download list into styled cards with icons/size/date.
- Add brief summaries and last-modified timestamps next to each download.
- Commit and push any outstanding local edits (e.g., `about.html`) so the repo state is clean.

If you'd like me to commit your recent edits to `about.html` and `resources.html`, say "Please commit my local edits" and I will stage, commit, and push them.
# üé® Partially Generated Website


Note:  I chose this AFTER I thought about redoing my graphic laden prototypes from a beginning templete from wC3schools.  This provided what I needed 
from a picture of what it should look like with HTML and CSS (and little JS ).

***** IF THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, LET ME KNOW AND WILL TRY TO DO THE REMAINING 5-6 ASSIGNMENTS MANUALLY (AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, WITHOUTH TEMPLATES) ****
