# 🎨 Generated Website


Note:  I chose this AFTER I thought about redoing my graphic laden prototypes from a beginning templete from wC3schools.  This provided what I needed 
from a picture of what it should look like with HTML and CSS (and little JS ).

***** IF THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, LET ME KNOW AND WILL TRY TO DO THE REMAINING 5-6 ASSIGNMENTS MANUALLY (AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, WITHOUTH TEMPLATES) ****
